# Certificates Directory

You can generate and place your SSL certificate and key in this directory.
You can generate a SSL certificate by running command lines below:

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

You can see the installation docs in detail [here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#mkcert).

Please ensure that the certificate file name is `localhost.pem` and the certificate key file name is `localhost-key.pem`.
